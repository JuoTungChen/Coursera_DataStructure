# Cousera_DataStructure

After completed the Algorithmic Toolbox online course on Coursera, I decided to gain more knowledge in various data structures.
&nbsp;

## The main goals of this course includes:
- List the basic data structures
- Analyze operations with data structures
- Choose appropriate basic data structure for a task at hand
- Apply basic data structures in programming challenges
- Develop a program that simulates network packet processing
